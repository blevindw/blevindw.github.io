This little bot, written in Python, runs on a Raspberry Pi 4. It communicates using the Telegram app to multiple users using another library called telepot. You'll need to install telepot to make it work. It has been updated to Python 3.

Currently, it provides the following functions:

1- Maintains a grocery list
2- Maintains a todo list
3- Maintains locations of grocery items in a store. (Such as cinnamon is on the baking aisle.)
4- Allows for multiple houses, and users default to their location. (Ie. Dads House, Elis Apartment, etc)
5- Miscellaneous commands:
  a- Displays command help
  b- RPi CPU temperature
  c- current users

Future releases will upgrade the todo list and grocery list functionality. I have a basic way to push notices to users via Telegram, so I'm sure I'll be doing something fun with that.
